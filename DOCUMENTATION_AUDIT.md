### Specific Examples

#### README.md

**Before:**
```
Production-grade churn retention system combining:
- **PPO decision policy** for optimal contact timing, offer selection, and budget management
- **RLHF message generation** (SFT → Reward Model → PPO) for personalized, policy-compliant retention messages
```

**After:**
```
A churn retention system that uses machine learning to decide when to contact customers and what offers to give them.

What it does:
- **PPO decision policy** - Decides when to contact, which offer to give, and manages budget
- **RLHF message generation** - Creates personalized messages using SFT → Reward Model → PPO
```

#### DEPLOYMENT.md

**Before:**
```
This guide walks through deploying the Churn-Saver RLHF+PPO system to Google Cloud Platform.

## Prerequisites

1. **GCP Project**: Active GCP project with billing enabled
```

**After:**
```
How to deploy the Churn-Saver system to Google Cloud Platform.

## What You Need

1. **GCP Project**: GCP project with billing turned on
```

#### QUICKSTART.md

**Before:**
```
Get the Churn-Saver RLHF+PPO system running in 5 minutes.

Expected output: **46 tests passed** ✓
```

**After:**
```
Get the system running in 5 minutes.

You should see: **46 tests passed**
```

#### PROJECT_SUMMARY.md

**Before:**
```
This repository contains a production-grade ML system that combines **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** for churn retention decisions with **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** for personalized message generation. The system is fully GCP-native with comprehensive testing, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code.
```

**After:**
```
This is an ML system that uses **PPO** to decide when to contact customers and **RLHF** to create personalized messages. It runs on GCP with full testing, CI/CD, and infrastructure code.
```

### Cost Estimates

Changed from USD to INR (Indian Rupees):

**Before:**
```
- Cloud Run: ~$5-20 (low traffic)
- GCS: ~$1-5 (small datasets)
- **Total**: ~$10-30/month for dev environment
```

**After:**
```
- Cloud Run: ₹400-1600 (low traffic)
- GCS: ₹80-400 (small datasets)
- **Total**: Around ₹800-2400/month for dev
```

### Section Titles

Made more direct:

- "Quickstart (Local)" → "Quick Start (Local)"
- "Prerequisites" → "What You Need" / "What you need"
- "Data Preparation" → "Preparing Data"
- "Training Pipeline" → "Training Models"
- "Security & Compliance" → "Security"
- "Monitoring & SLOs" → "Monitoring"
- "Cost Optimization" → "Cost"
- "Teardown" → "Cleanup"
- "Development Workflow" → "Development Process"
- "Troubleshooting" → "Common Problems"

### Removed Elements

- Emojis from feature lists (kept only in test output where appropriate)
- "Built with ❤️" footer
- Excessive use of checkmarks and decorative elements
- Marketing buzzwords
- Formal academic language

## Result

All documentation now:
- Uses simple, direct Indian English
- Has neutral, factual tone
- Avoids fancy words and marketing language
- Makes instructions clear and to the point
- Uses rupees for cost estimates
- Reads like technical docs written by engineers for engineers
