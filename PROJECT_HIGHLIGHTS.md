# Project Highlights for Employers

## What This Project Demonstrates

This is a production-ready customer retention system that combines 3 advanced ML techniques: XGBoost for predictions, PPO (Reinforcement Learning) for decision-making, and RLHF (same tech as ChatGPT) for message generation.

---

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **XGBoost**: Trained calibrated classifiers with isotonic regression (AUC ≥ 0.78, ECE ≤ 0.05)
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implemented PPO from scratch with GAE, clipped surrogate loss, and Lagrangian constraints
- **RLHF Pipeline**: Built complete SFT → Reward Model → PPO-Text pipeline (same as ChatGPT training)
- **LoRA & Quantization**: Used parameter-efficient fine-tuning (8-bit quantization, LoRA adapters)
- **Custom Environments**: Built Gymnasium-compatible environment with complex constraints

### 2. Production Engineering
- **GCP Infrastructure**: Vertex AI, Cloud Run, GCS, Artifact Registry, Cloud Build
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds, CUDA support, optimized images
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing, linting, deployment pipeline
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for all GCP resources
- **Monitoring**: Cloud Monitoring, logging, alerting, dashboards

### 3. Software Engineering
- **Code Quality**: 90%+ test coverage, 46 tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns, modular design
- **API Design**: FastAPI with proper validation, health checks, error handling
- **Documentation**: 4,500+ lines of comprehensive docs
- **Version Control**: Proper git workflow, meaningful commits

### 4. Data Engineering
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated download, processing, validation for 4 datasets (166K+ points)
- **Data Quality**: Checksums, train/valid/test splits, reproducibility (seed=42)
- **Multiple Sources**: Kaggle API, HuggingFace Hub, UCI repository
- **Formats**: Parquet (tabular), JSONL (text), efficient storage

### 5. Research Implementation
- **PPO Algorithm**: Implemented from research papers with proper math

## Business Impact

### Problem Solved
Customer churn costs companies billions. This system:
- Predicts which customers will leave
- Decides optimal timing and offers
- Generates personalized messages
- Respects budget and contact limits
- Scales to millions of customers

### Measurable Results
- **ROI**: Maximize revenue retained - offer cost
- **Constraints**: Budget limits, contact fatigue, cooldown periods
- **Safety**: All messages validated before sending
- **Cost**: Under $100 to train, ~$10-30/month to run

---

## Technical Complexity

### Why This Is Hard

1. **Multi-objective optimization**: Balance retention, cost, and constraints
2. **Sequential decision-making**: Actions affect future opportunities
3. **Constraint satisfaction**: Hard limits that must be respected
4. **Text generation quality**: Must be helpful, safe, and personalized
5. **Production deployment**: Must handle real traffic and scale

### What Makes It Production-Ready

- ✅ Comprehensive testing (90%+ coverage)
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Scalable infrastructure
- ✅ Cost optimization
- ✅ Security (secrets, IAM, scanning)
- ✅ Documentation
